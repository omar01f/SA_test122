    <h1>About Us</h1>

    <p>Akletna is a modern Egyptian-inspired restaurant created with a passion for serving fresh, authentic, and flavorful dishes. The idea began as a student project, but quickly turned into something bigger—a vision to bring traditional Egyptian taste into a well-designed digital experience.</p>

    <p>Our goal is to create a dining atmosphere that blends comfort with tradition. From classic meals like koshary, molokheya, and mahshi, to modern twists on local favorites, we aim to deliver a memorable experience to every visitor.</p>

    <p>At Akletna, we believe food should be simple, honest, and crafted with care. Our team works to ensure every dish reflects the warmth and hospitality of Egyptian culture.</p>

    <p>Thank you for visiting Akletna. We hope our website reflects both our creativity and our dedication to bringing good food to everyone who loves Egyptian cuisine.</p>
